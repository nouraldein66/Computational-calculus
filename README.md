# Computational-calculus
A repo for showing the effect of calculus in understanding data and other computational applications.

# Project 1: Global temperature analysis
This project aims to show how rates of change help us in gaining more insights from the data, we begin by visualizing the original data then visualize it after differentiation, and explain after it how these rates of change will give us more insights.
